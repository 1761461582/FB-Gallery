FB-Gallery
==========
  
This project is an attempt to re-implement the experience of inaction from facebook timeline to photo browser and to figure out how the animations are done. I may not completely implement all features in it. The demo is to illustrate how can be done. 

TODO:  
- Orientation handling
- Multiple photos
- Photo zooming
- Photo description
- Support remote image

Happy Coding!
